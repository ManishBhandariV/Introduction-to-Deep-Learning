# Introduction-to-Deep-Learning
This repository contains scripts to get started with Deep Learning. Apart for the low level implementation, it also contains implementations of the various Neural network architectures using the keras libraries. All the scripts use Tensorflow 2.x

The folder  MLP contains low level implemetation of a multilayer perceptron. Further it also contains few failed scripts and their visualization using tensorboard. The file Tensorflowcore contains various small programming tasks solved using Tensorflow functions.
